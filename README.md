# StickerMakerDesktop

A desktop sticker maker for... a specific chatting app! Legality of specifying the app name is questionable...

## Installation

Clone the repo, then double click / run `main.py`. Watch as the magic happens!

## Usage

After selecting a picture via drag-and-drop, selecting from a file, or uploading from clipboard, the program will create a sticker pack file for you and save it at your specified location (either to a file or to clipboard).

Then, open this file on your phone in the [Sticker Maker app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marsvard.stickermakerforwhatsapp). Click the "Add stickers" button, and you're good to go!
